puts "When I go to the arcade with my #{plural_noun1},
there are lots of games to play.  I spend a lot of time
there with my friends.  In X-Men, you can be different
#{plural_noun2}.  The point of the game is to #{verb1}
every robot.  You also need to save people, and then you
can go to the next level.  In Star Wars you are Luke
Skywalker and you try to destroy every #{noun1}.  In a
car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat every
computerized vehicle that you are #{verb2} against.
There are a whole lot of other cool games.  When you play
some games you win #{plural_noun3} for certain scores.
Once you're done, you can cash in your tickets to get
a big #{noun2}.  You can save your #{plural_noun4} for
another time.  When I went to this arcade, I didn't
belive how much fun it would be.  You might annoy your
parents by asking them over and over if you can go back
to there.  So far I had a lot of fun every time I've been
to this great aracde!"
